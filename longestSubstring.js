// Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters - Brute force approach

//Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
//string s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces

//Declare the function lengthOfLongestSubstring via the function expression
var lengthOfLongestSubstring = function(s) {
    //Check each character in a string
    //For each new character push it into an array of substrings
    //If a character is repeated in a substring break execution & start a new substring to add in the array
    //Once all characters have been checked find the substring in the array that has the longest length property 
    //Return the length of longest substring
};
