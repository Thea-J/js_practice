"JS is a dynamic, scripting programming language used to created responsive web applications. "
JS adds behaviour to a website by:
Manipulate the DOM (By selecting & updating HTML & CSS)
Listens & responds to events occurring in the browser
Communicate with the server

There are a wide range of things you can build with Javascript: 
- Single page applications
- Web apps
- Web servers
- Mobile apps

"One of the drawbacks of Javascript it the way that it handles OOP (Object oriented programming)."
